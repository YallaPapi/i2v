These are mostly variants of a few core caption “archetypes” + delivery rules. Below is a breakdown and then reusable rules you can plug new ideas into.

***

## Main caption categories

1. **Fake innocence / “we’re just friends”**
   - Plays on mismatch between words and obviously sexual/romantic behavior.  
   - Examples:  
     - `"We're just friends" also us:`  
     - `"He just wants to sleep with you" I want to sleep with him too`  
     - `"Okay I'll come to your place but nothing is gonna happen" / Literally me 1 minute later:`  
   - Pattern:  
     - Setup: a “wholesome” or low‑stakes claim.  
     - Punchline: visual or second line shows it’s clearly sexual/romantic.

2. **POV / situation setups**
   - Uses POV or “when…” to drop the viewer into a specific moment.  
   - Examples:  
     - `POV: You facetime your bumble match before meeting irl`  
     - `POV: he said he want to stay loyal to his long distance girlfriend and ...`  
     - `when you're halfway through an argument and start to realise he's right`  
     - `When you're in a bad mood but remember the face he makes when he 🥜s`  
   - Pattern:  
     - Start with “POV:” or “When…” or “Me when…”  
     - Describe a highly specific micro‑moment or thought spiral.

3. **Fake “studies” / mock-informational**
   - Poses as research, statistics, rules, or how‑to.  
   - Examples:  
     - `A new study found that women who used a man's face instead of a chair had their bloating, back pain and anxiety reduced by 95%`  
     - `Rule number 1 of life: shaved needs to be eaten the same day, cuz next day it's a cactus`  
     - `4 disadvantages of using the back door ...`  
   - Pattern:  
     - “A new study found…”, “Rule number…”, “4 disadvantages…”  
     - Then slide into obviously sexual or absurd content.

4. **Overt sexual innuendo / shock humor**
   - Very explicit, often uses emojis/slang to dodge filters.  
   - Examples:  
     - `I'm so nice I pretend to gag on the small ones too`  
     - `Changing my throat's name to daycare so you can drop your kids off`  
     - `Just the tip never hurt a friendship`  
     - `I hate small talk. Just ask me if I want round 3.`  
   - Pattern:  
     - One sentence punchline.  
     - Often mixes wholesome framing with explicit act.

5. **Female desire / power and “feral” energy**
   - Centers her horniness, standards, or control.  
   - Examples:  
     - `Girl math is not wanting to get pregnant + having the feral urge to scream creampie me during ovulation`  
     - `I think my biggest turn on is knowing i turned you on`  
     - `my toxic trait is that we will literally never finish an argument because you'll just be finishing in my`  
   - Pattern:  
     - “Girl math”, “my toxic trait”, “I think my biggest turn on…”  
     - Flip the usual “male gaze” into her being the one dictating terms.

6. **“Gooning” / kink‑coded subculture captions**
   - Uses niche internet sex slang and meta‑horny behavior.  
   - Examples:  
     - `why do people get mad when you g0On to them. I'd lowkey feel chosen…`  
     - `when me and my hg are gooning at the same time and we genuinely reach flow state`  
     - `If you send him pics he's just gonna goon to them`  
   - Pattern:  
     - Casual lowercase, internet slang.  
     - Treats niche kink as normal daily activity.

7. **Mock Q&A / “genuine question”**
   - Asks guys something that exposes sexual curiosity or humor.  
   - Examples:  
     - `Genuine question: what do guys do with it when they poop ... let it dangle down, put it on the seat, hold it.`  
     - `Men please be honest, how many for you to try a bearded clam from 1984?`  
     - `Another genuine question to my dear men: Does it float in water?`  
   - Pattern:  
     - “Genuine question:” / “Men please be honest…”  
     - Childlike curiosity about an obviously dirty topic.

8. **Textbook “hook” questions for comments**
   - Direct prompts to engage men/women in comments.  
   - Examples:  
     - `Boys let's be honest in the comments: which mistakes do people do when it comes to z-jobs?`  
     - `Be honest ... What are the most common mistakes they make when eating`  
   - Pattern:  
     - Call out audience (“Boys”, “Men”, “Ladies”).  
     - Ask about mistakes/preferences in sex.

9. **Relatable chaotic bedroom / relationship behavior**
   - Sexual but framed as chaotic daily life.  
   - Examples:  
     - `When I'm having a hard time falling asleep so I become a professional dj then change my sheets at 2am for absolutely no reason`  
     - `Me preparing to get on top for a total of 34 seconds`  
     - `When he likes lasting for ages but ur legs, arms and insides are already failing after 5 min:`  
   - Pattern:  
     - Start with “When I…”, “Me…”, “When he…”  
     - Pair normal behavior with an overshare.

10. **Text + visual punchline format**
    - Caption is only the setup; punchline is visual.  
    - Examples:  
      - `POV : you decided to celebrate with music` (visual is wild)  
      - `when your selfies aren't hitting so you have to pull out this forbidden move:`  
      - `Literally me 1 minute later:`  
    - Pattern:  
      - Setup ends with colon or implied “then this happens”.  
      - The video content carries the joke.

## Style rules (tone, formatting, voice)

1. **Tone & POV**
   - First person or second person (“me”, “you”, “he”).  
   - Casual, lowercase, often slightly “unhinged” / feral.  
   - Mix vulnerability and confidence: “I’m submissive af when I’m treated right. I'll do any & everything for mine happily”.

2. **Language tricks**
   - Use emojis instead of explicit words: 😺, 🥜, etc.  
   - Deliberate misspelling/spaces to dodge filters: `g0On`, `dihhh`, `syd`, `backshOts`.  
   - Fragmented sentences and line breaks for rhythm:
     - `that skin to skin, leg  
       BETWEEN leg, head on  
       chest sleep with that one  
       person would hit SOO0  
       different rn`

3. **Hooks**
   - Start with:
     - `POV:`  
     - `When…` / `when u…`  
     - `Genuine question:`  
     - `Be honest ...`  
     - `"quote" also me:`  
     - `Rule number 1:`  
   - Or directly with a shocking statement:  
     - `I'm so nice I pretend to gag on the small ones too`

4. **Implied visual**
   - Many captions assume a matching visual: argument, facetime, bed, mirror, etc.  
   - You can often write a setup that will work with any “thirsty” or flirty shot.

## Practical generation rules (templates you can reuse)

You can think in terms of templates + fill‑in slots.

### 1. Quote vs reality template
- Pattern:  
  - `"X" also me:` or `"X" also us:`  
- X = something “innocent”, “serious” or socially acceptable.  
- Example:  
  - `"I'm focusing on myself this year" also me:`  
  - `"We can just chill and watch a movie" also me:`  

### 2. POV template
- Pattern:  
  - `POV: [hyper specific situation that implies sex or tension]`  
- Examples:  
  - `POV: you hear my bracelet clinking while I'm "adjusting the sheets"`  
  - `POV: you said we’re just cuddling and now my leg is already over you`

### 3. “When…” relatability template
- Pattern:  
  - `when [trigger] but [feral/sexual reaction you pretend you don't have]`  
- Examples:  
  - `when he smells good and suddenly I'm ready to risk my whole life plan`  
  - `when you're mad at him but remember how he looks between your legs`

### 4. Fake research / rule template
- Pattern A:  
  - `A new study found that [ridiculous sexual statement + %]`  
- Pattern B:  
  - `Rule number 1 of [topic]: [sexual punchline]`  
- Examples:  
  - `A new study found that sitting on his face 3 times a week reduces stress by 110%`  
  - `Rule number 1 of backshots: make sure the hair is in a ponytail, not in your mouth`

### 5. Genuine question to men template
- Pattern:  
  - `Genuine question:` / `Men please be honest:` / `Another genuine question to my dear men:`  
  - Followed by weirdly specific curiosity.  
- Examples:  
  - `Genuine question: how do you just walk around with that thing in your pants all day and act normal`  
  - `Men please be honest: do you ever think about who taught her that move or is it just vibes`

### 6. Comment-bait “Be honest” template
- Pattern:  
  - `Be honest ... [ask for confessions / mistakes / preferences]`  
- Examples:  
  - `Be honest ... what's the biggest L you took in the bedroom and still think about at night`  
  - `Boys be honest in the comments: do you even know what you're doing down there or are you freestyling`

### 7. “My toxic trait / girl math” template
- Pattern A:  
  - `my toxic trait is [sexual or chaotic behavior]`  
- Pattern B:  
  - `Girl math is [contradiction between not wanting consequences vs feral urge]`  
- Examples:  
  - `my toxic trait is thinking one good cuddle can fix years of daddy issues`  
  - `Girl math is not wanting a boyfriend + getting sad when no one blows up your phone`

### 8. “If you…” consequence template
- Pattern:  
  - `if you [normal action] I'm going to [over-the-top horny reaction]`  
- Examples:  
  - `if you hug me from behind I'm just going to assume you want three kids and a joint mortgage`  
  - `if you say "come here" in the right tone I'm already on my way without thinking`

### 9. “I hate X / I’m not into X” twist
- Pattern:  
  - `I hate [normal thing]. Just [sexual direct ask instead].`  
- Example:  
  - `I hate small talk. Just ask me what position I think about the most`  

### 10. “Sometimes I…” overshare template
- Pattern:  
  - `sometimes I [normal texting / scrolling / chilling] with [explicit twist]`  
- Examples:  
  - `sometimes I be answering your texts with my panties halfway off, like it's nothing`  
  - `sometimes I scroll your profile and plan dates in my head you don't even know about`

## Guardrails so you don’t drift off‑brand

- Always:
  - Keep it **short** (1–3 lines max).  
  - Use casual chat grammar: “u”, “ur”, “idc”, “rn”, “lowkey”, “highkey”.  
  - Keep the narrator confident, playful, and a bit shameless.
- Often:
  - Add line breaks for emphasis.  
  - Swap explicit words for emojis or slightly altered spelling.
- Avoid (if you want to match this set closely):
  - Long explanatory paragraphs.  
  - Very formal grammar or proper punctuation everywhere.  
  - Purely wholesome captions with no sexual undertone.
