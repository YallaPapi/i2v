# Product Requirements Document: AI Content Factory for OF Managers

## Executive Summary

A bulk content generation platform purpose-built for OnlyFans managers and creators. The platform enables users to generate 100+ pieces of social media and NSFW content in under an hour using template-based generation, eliminating the need for manual prompting, technical knowledge, or one-by-one API calls.

**Target User:** OnlyFans managers who need to create bulk social media content (TikTok, Instagram, Twitter) and NSFW content for multiple models.

**Core Value Proposition:** "Generate a week's worth of content in an hour. No prompting required."

**Key Differentiators:**
- Template-based (no learning curve)
- Bulk generation (100+ pieces at once)
- End-to-end pipeline (image → video → audio → lip sync)
- Purpose-built for OF workflow
- Current events integration (auto trend-jacking)

---

## Phase 1: Template System

### 1.1 Template Architecture

Each template is a pre-configured generation recipe that includes:
- Base prompt structure with variables
- Recommended model(s)
- Output format (image, video, carousel)
- Variation parameters (what changes between generations)
- Caption templates (on-screen text)
- Aspect ratio and duration settings

```
Template Structure:
{
  "id": "cosplay_thirst_tiktok",
  "name": "Cosplay Thirst Trap",
  "category": "social_sfw",
  "output_type": "video",
  "duration": "5-10s",
  "aspect_ratio": "9:16",
  "base_prompt": "beautiful woman in {costume} cosplay, {pose}, {setting}, professional photography...",
  "variables": {
    "costume": ["anime schoolgirl", "nurse", "maid", "catgirl", ...],
    "pose": ["standing", "sitting", "looking back", ...],
    "setting": ["bedroom", "studio", "outdoor", ...]
  },
  "caption_templates": [
    "POV: your gf dressed up for you",
    "would you still love me if i was a {costume}",
    "the things i'd do for attention",
    ...
  ],
  "recommended_model": "gpt-image-1.5",
  "video_model": "wan"
}
```

### 1.2 Launch Templates (Research Required)

Research and implement the following template categories:

**Social Media Templates (SFW/Spicy for TikTok/IG):**
1. Cosplay thirst trap with captions
2. Gym/fitness thirst content
3. "Get ready with me" (GRWM)
4. POV boyfriend/girlfriend scenarios
5. Outfit transition videos
6. "Day in my life" aesthetic clips
7. Reply to comment format
8. Dancing/lip sync style
9. ASMR-adjacent (eating, whispering)
10. Hot takes / opinion format

**NSFW Templates (for OF/Fansly):**
11. Lingerie photoshoot variations
12. Implied nude teases
13. Solo content variations
14. POV intimate scenarios
15. Roleplay scenarios (nurse, teacher, etc.)

**Brainrot/Viral Templates:**

---

## Phase 2: Carousel Generator

### 2.1 Carousel System

Carousels are multi-image posts that tell a story or sequence. Instagram and TikTok photo mode heavily favor this format.

**Carousel Types:**
1. **Story Progression** - Images that tell a narrative (getting ready, date night, etc.)
2. **Outfit Showcase** - Multiple looks/outfits in sequence
3. **Before/After** - Transformation sequences
4. **Ranking Format** - "Ranking [things] as a [type of girl]"
5. **This or That** - Comparison slides
6. **POV Sequences** - "POV: you take me on a date" with multiple scenes

**Technical Requirements:**
- Generate 3-10 images with consistent face/identity
- Maintain style consistency across carousel
- Support text overlays per slide
- Export as individual images or combined video slideshow
- Support transitions for video carousel format

### 2.2 Carousel Template Structure

```
Carousel Template:
{
  "id": "date_night_carousel",
  "name": "Date Night POV",
  "slides": [
    {"scene": "getting ready in mirror", "caption": "getting ready for our date"},
    {"scene": "outfit reveal full body", "caption": "do you like it?"},
    {"scene": "in car passenger seat", "caption": "pick me up energy"},
    {"scene": "at restaurant table", "caption": "my face when you're paying"},
    {"scene": "walking at night street", "caption": "best night ever"}
  ],
  "variation_options": {
    "outfit_style": ["elegant dress", "casual chic", "sexy"],
    "location_vibe": ["fancy", "casual", "romantic"]
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Research Tasks

- [ ] Analyze top-performing Instagram carousels in OF niche
- [ ] Research TikTok photo mode trends
- [ ] Document ideal slide counts (3, 5, 7, 10)
- [ ] Test face consistency across multi-image generations
- [ ] Develop transition templates for video carousels

---

## Phase 3: Current Events / Trending Topics Engine

### 3.1 Headline Scraper System

Automatically pull trending topics and news headlines to generate timely, engagement-optimized content. This solves the "what should I post about" problem.

**Data Sources:**
- Google Trends API
- Twitter/X trending topics
- NewsAPI for headlines
- Reddit trending (r/all, relevant subreddits)
- TikTok trending sounds/hashtags (if API available)

**Content Generation Flow:**
```
1. Scrape headlines/trends daily (or on-demand)
2. Filter for relevant/safe topics (no politics, tragedy, controversy)
3. Generate caption templates based on trends
4. User selects which trends to use
5. System generates content with trend-based captions
```

### 3.2 Caption Templates for Trends

```
Trend-based caption formats:
- "POV: your gf just found out about {HEADLINE}"
- "me pretending to care about {TOPIC} for the algorithm"
- "the feminine urge to {TREND_ACTION}"
- "he asked me about {TOPIC} and i said..."
- "hot take: {OPINION_ON_TREND}"
- "rating {TRENDING_THING} as a hot girl"
```

### 3.3 Safety Filters

Topics to auto-filter OUT:
- Political content (elections, politicians)
- Tragedies (deaths, disasters, shootings)
- Controversial social issues
- Anything involving minors
- Brand-specific content (potential legal issues)

Topics to prioritize:
- Pop culture (movies, music, celebrities)
- Sports events
- Viral moments
- Seasonal events (holidays, seasons)
- Internet culture / memes

### 3.4 Research Tasks

- [ ] Evaluate news/trend APIs (NewsAPI, Google Trends, etc.)
- [ ] Build topic classification system (safe vs unsafe)
- [ ] Test trend-to-caption generation with LLM
- [ ] Develop freshness scoring (prioritize recent trends)
- [ ] Create trend category taxonomy

---

## Phase 4: Bulk Generation Engine

### 4.1 Core Requirements

The system must handle:
- 100+ generations in a single batch job
- Multiple concurrent users with separate queues
- Progress tracking and ETA estimates
- Failure handling and automatic retries
- Organized output (folders by template, date, etc.)

### 4.2 Variation Engine

When generating bulk content, the system automatically varies:
- Outfits/costumes (from template variables)
- Poses and angles
- Settings/backgrounds
- Caption text (from caption templates)
- Minor prompt variations for diversity

**Variation Strategy:**
```
For 100 generations of "Cosplay TikTok" template:
- 10 different costumes × 10 variations each
- Each variation has unique pose, setting, caption
- Face/identity remains consistent (same model)
```

### 4.3 Queue Management

```
Job Queue Structure:
{
  "job_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "template": "cosplay_thirst_tiktok",
  "quantity": 100,
  "model_profile": "model_456",  // Face reference
  "status": "processing",
  "progress": {
    "completed": 45,
    "failed": 2,
    "pending": 53
  },
  "created_at": "2024-01-08T10:00:00Z",
  "estimated_completion": "2024-01-08T11:15:00Z"
}
```

### 4.4 Research Tasks

- [ ] Benchmark generation speeds per model
- [ ] Design optimal batch sizes for GPU efficiency
- [ ] Implement job priority system
- [ ] Build progress notification system (webhooks, email)
- [ ] Design output organization structure

---

## Phase 5: Model Identity System

### 5.1 Model Profiles

Each OF model (the person being generated) has a profile:
- Reference images (3-10 face photos)
- Body type preferences
- Style preferences
- Voice sample (for audio generation)
- Custom LoRA (if trained)

### 5.2 Face Consistency

Critical requirement: Generated content must look like the same person across all outputs.

**Approaches:**
1. **Reference image injection** - Include face reference in each generation
2. **IP-Adapter / InstantID** - Face embedding models
3. **Custom LoRA** - Train model-specific LoRA (higher quality, more effort)
4. **Face swap post-processing** - Generate generic, swap face after

### 5.3 Voice Cloning

For audio content:
- User uploads 1-3 minute voice sample
- System creates voice clone using XTTS/RVC
- Clone is used for all audio generation for that model
- Supports speech and vocalizations

### 5.4 Research Tasks

- [ ] Test face consistency methods (IP-Adapter, InstantID, LoRA)
- [ ] Benchmark quality vs speed tradeoffs
- [ ] Evaluate voice cloning quality with short samples
- [ ] Design model profile data structure
- [ ] Build reference image validation (quality, face detection)
