TikTok selfie-style video of the same woman from the image, framed from mid-thigh up. She faces the camera directly and keeps strong eye contact, smiling playfully and occasionally laughing. She gently shifts her weight from one hip to the other, slightly swaying side to side, and once in a while tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. The camera is a handheld smartphone in portrait orientation, mostly fixed but with a tiny natural handheld shake like a real TikTok. The background stays simple and slightly blurred, soft indoor lighting, realistic skin texture and hair motion, ultra realistic phone video, no new people, no big camera moves, no text on screen.

TikTok-style selfie video of the same woman from the image, standing in her room and facing the camera. She does a simple TikTok dance: gentle upper-body bounce to the beat, small shoulder moves, tiny hand gestures near her face, and a playful smile. She never leaves the frame and keeps looking at the camera with flirty eye contact. The camera is a front smartphone camera held at arm's length, with slight natural hand shake and no cinematic camera moves. Lighting is bright and even like a typical TikTok in a bedroom, realistic colors, natural skin, no cartoon style, no extra characters, no text.

TikTok selfie video of the same woman from the image, framed from chest up.

She tilts her head, raises one eyebrow, then laughs softly while still looking into the camera. The camera is a static smartphone on a tripod, minimal motion except for a tiny vibration, like a real TikTok. Background is a normal bedroom or living room, slightly blurred, warm indoor lighting, ultra realistic, no added text, no new people.

TikTok-style video of the same woman from the image, sitting cross-legged on her bed facing the camera. She talks to the viewer: she gestures with one hand, occasionally points at the screen as if pointing at the caption, and laughs at her own joke. Her expression changes from curious to amused while maintaining eye contact with the camera. The camera is a phone propped up on a shelf, so the framing is stable with only minimal shake. Soft daylight from a window, cozy bedroom background slightly blurred, realistic phone footage look, no cinematic movements, no extra people, no on-screen text added by the model.

TikTok-style video of the same woman from the image.

The camera is a static smartphone in portrait mode, placed on a shelf or tripod, only a tiny vibration like real footage. Lighting is bright and natural, interior background slightly blurred, ultra realistic, no extra characters, no added text.

TikTok POV close-up video of the same woman from the image, framed tightly on her face and shoulders. She keeps direct eye contact with the viewer, slowly changing facial expressions: neutral, soft smile, playful smirk, a quick lip bite, then a genuine laugh. She moves very little, just subtle head tilts and tiny shifts forward and back, like someone filming themselves on TikTok while holding the phone at arm's length. The camera is a handheld smartphone front camera with mild natural shake, indoor lighting with soft shadows, highly realistic phone camera look, no cartoon effects, no new people, no text or stickers.
